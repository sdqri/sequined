# sequined 
Sequined is a simple tool I'm developing to explore synchronization problems in crawlers and address the challenge of measuring the freshness and age of web data. Measuring freshness precisely is difficult because it requires an immediate comparison of real-world data (to which we do not have direct access) with our local copy. I'm working to find ways to estimate freshness by simulating changes in both website structure and data patterns. My goal is to gather insights that will help refine my methods for refreshing data and meet performance requirements per my project's specifications.
